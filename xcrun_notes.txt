#notes on how to do some of this same stuff via xcrun, on the command line. this info may be dated. it often is.

To close all active simulators run:
xcrun simctl shutdown all

To reset all simulators run:
xcrun simctl erase all

You can filter what simulator to close/reset like this:
xcrun simctl shutdown F36B238F-3ED6-4E10-BB5A-0726151916FA
xcrun simctl erase F36B238F-3ED6-4E10-BB5A-0726151916FA

List all sims:
xcrun simctl list

To run any simulator by GUID (iphone 13 mini - the best phone ever, obviously - example):
xcrun simctl boot 85B45BB1-2174-43CA-9D9C-B065B1644617

To install app to the booted simulator:
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/your.app

To remove app from the booted simulator:
xcrun simctl uninstall booted /path/to/your.app

To launch the app in the booted simulator:
xcrun simctl launch booted "com.app.bundleIdentifier"

"com.app.bundleIdentifier" is your CFBundleIdentifier in Info.plist
