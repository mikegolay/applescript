# applescripts for your enjoyment

various hacky scripts to do hacky things on macos, usually with the goal of clicking a little less, to eliminating clicks altogether.

in general i would recommend creating an alias in zsh or bash and pointing to your script, like so:<br>
`alias [your_alias_name]="osascript ~/[path to your aliases]/applescripts/[your_alias_name].applescript"`

and then running from terminal.

here we go.
